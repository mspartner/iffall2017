          <b>Verse 1</b> <br />
          You said you ain't the one to to jump in a relation <br />
          And I don't mind, but when we touch it's elevation <br />
          Up, up, up, up, up <br />
          Up, up, up, up, up <br />
          You speak my lingo, we don't need no translation <br />
          I never need a break 'cause we feel like vacation <br />
          Up, up, up, up, up <br />
          Got me up, up, up, up, up <br />
          <br />
          <b>Pre-Chorus</b> <br />
          Go ahead and feel what you feel <br />
          I want you closer to me <br />
          <br />
          <b>Chorus</b> <br />
          <span class="smn">Say my name</span> <br />
          Wear it out like a sweater that you love <br />
          'Cause I can't get enough when you <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name</span> <br />
          Spill it out like a drink you should have skipped <br />
          You're the one I wanna get when you <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name</span> <br />
          Let it roll, let it roll off your tongue <br />
          Let me know, let me know what you want <br />
          Wear it out like a sweater that you love <br />
          Cause I can't get enough when you <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name</span> <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name</span> <br />
          <br />
          <b>Verse 2</b> <br />
          Don't need no list of where you been, no information <br />
          You got me running out, out of patience <br />
          Up, up, up, up, up <br />
          Got me up, up, up, up <br />
          I like the interaction, you got my attention <br />
          I'm not in love, but I'm loving the situation <br />
          Up, up, up, up, up <br />
          If you're down, don't dare to stop <br />
          <br />
          <b>Pre-Chorus</b> <br />
          Go ahead and feel what you feel<br />
          I want you closer to me<br />
          <br />
          <b>Chorus</b> <br />
          <span class="smn">Just say my name</span><br />
          Wear it out like a sweater that you love <br />
          'Cause I can't get enough when you <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name</span> <br />
          Spill it out like a drink you should have skipped <br />
          You're the one I wanna get when you <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name</span> <br />
          Let it roll, let it roll off your tongue <br />
          Let me know, let me know what you want <br />
          Wear it out like a sweater that you love <br />
          'Cause I can't get enough when you <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name</span> <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name</span> <br />
          <br />
          <b>Bridge</b> <br />
          Go ahead and feel what you feel<br />
          'Cause I need what I need, and I say what I mean<br />
          <br />
          <b>Chorus</b> <br />
          <span class="smn">Just say my name</span><br />
          <span class="name">(say my name)</span> <br />
          Wear it out like a sweater that you love <br />
          'Cause I can't get enough when you <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name (say my name)</span> <br />
          Spill it out like a drink you should have skipped <br />
          You're the one I wanna get when you <br />
          <span class="name">Say my name</span> <br />
          Let it roll, let it roll off your tongue <br />
          Let me know, let me know what you want <br />
          Wear it out like a sweater that you love <br />
          'Cause I can't get enough when you <br />

          Say my name <br />
          Say my name </span><br />
