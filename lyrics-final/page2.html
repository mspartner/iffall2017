          <span class="pink">Tove Styrke</span> (born 19 November 1992) is a Swedish singer and songwriter who gained prominence after finishing in third place on Swedish Idol <br />in 2009. </p>
          <p>Following her Idol appearance, Styrke signed to Sony Music and began work on her debut album. Her first single, <span class="yellow">“Million Pieces”,</span> was released in June 2010, with her self-titled studio album following in November that year, reaching #10 on the Swedish album chart. Its second single, <span class="dblue">“White Light Moment”,</span> peaked at #2 on the Swedish singles chart. <span class="lblue">“Call My Name”</span> was released as the lead single for a revised version of the album in August 2011, which was released in November in Sweden and March/April the following year in Germany/the UK respectively. </p>
          <p>After wrapping up promotion for the album, Styrke took an extended break, eventually returning in May 2014 with the single <span class="pink">“Even If I’m Loud It Doesn’t Mean I’m Talking To You”.</span> The Borderline EP followed in November featuring the title track, which was released as a single the previous month. Styrke later confirmed the release of her second album, Kiddo, for June 2015, preceded by the singles <span class="yellow">“Ego”</span> and <span class="dblue">“Number One”.</span> The album was met with critical acclaim upon release, but did chart lower than her previous album, peaking at #14 in Sweden. </p>
          <p>Styrke returned in 2017 with the release of <a class="smn2" href="index.html">"Say My Name"</a> <br />in late April, and a third album is set to be released later in the year. </p>
