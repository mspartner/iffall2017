			<h2>Five Questions</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>I hope to learn the basics of HTML and CSS so I have enough knowledge to continue learning by myself, and effectively communicate with web developers in my future work.</li>
					<li>Crafting a work on the screen is more instant, and the mechanicals of creating something is more right/wrong than designing on paper. I think designing on screen will involve more specific design elements that we will have to pay attention to and keep track of to create an effective user experience.</li>
