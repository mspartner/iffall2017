  <h1>Discussion Points / Topics for Isabella</h1>
<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
	•	Is the design beautiful/striking/remarkable?<br />
		<span class="answer">Yes, the images are entertaining.  </span> <br />
	•	Does the design aesthetic relate to the concept? <br />
		<span class="answer">Yes—based on Flight of the Concords. Dry humor. </span>  <br />
	•	Do the imagery and design choices support the text? <br />
		<span class="answer">Yes, they enhance the text.</span>  <br />
	•	Is the aesthetic consistent? <br />
		<span class="answer">The first postcard’s aesthetic is a lil different, but I think it fits the sense of humor that the show uses, etc.  </span> <br />
	•	Is the aesthetic driving the concept, or vice-versa?<br />
		<span class="answer">The concept is driving the aesthetic.  </span> <br/>
	•	Is it legible? <br />
		<span class="answer">Yep. </span> <br />
	•	Are type size/color/face/treatment choices helping or hurting? <br />
		<span class="answer">I think they contribute to the concept! </span> <br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Structure</h2>
	•	What are the design’s visual priorities? <br />
		<span class="answer">The images of the actors.  </span> <br />
	•	Are design elements working in contrast, complement, or conflict? <br />
		<span class="answer"> The design elements are working together, so that the text complements the images. </span> <br />
	•	What elements do you consider foreground? Background? <br />
		<span class="answer">The background is either a solid color or pattern. The foreground is always the actors.  </span><br />
	•	How will the design accommodate variability in browser width? <br/>
		<span class="answer">The images will either be cropped or sized down to fit a smaller width, and then the text will move accordingly. </span> <br/>
	•	Is transparency, if used, used appropriately? <br/>
		<span class="answer">N/A </span> <br/>
<br />
<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	•	What happens at all of the sizes in between the desktop and mobile versions that have been provided?<br/>
		<span class="answer">The text will slowly move to the mobile position, while the image will also size down. Text will move to accommodate size down of image.  </span> <br/>
	•	At what point does text collide with imagery? At what point does contrast affect legibility?  <br/>
  <span class="answer">I don’t think contrast will be an issue. Maybe right before a mobile sized browser, the text will get a little close to images. </span> <br/>

	•	Are images presented with sufficient resolution, and without unintentional distortion or compression artifacts? <br/>
		<span class="answer">Images are perfectly fine! </span> <br />
	•	Have image edges all been considered and managed? <br/>
		<span class="answer">Yes. </span> <br/>
	•	Will elements such as fonts transfer as intended to the browser environment? <br/>
		<span class="answer">Yep. </span> <br/>
	•	Can you build it? <br/>
		<span class="answer">Yes.  </span> <br/>
